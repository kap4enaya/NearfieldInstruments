# Assignment:

We want to measure a set of points.

Each point is given by a X and a Y position

We have two measurement devices (A and B)

We need to visit each point with one of the devices (a point is visited by either A or B)

We want to show on a screen how these points are visited in time.

(So 2 machines are shown moving between measurements point)

We want a small UI to enter the X,Y points and show a list of them, i.e. something like a table with a column for X and a column for Y
Plus two field to enter X and Y and a button to add (no edit needed). Plus a button do start a simultation.
We want a display that shows the points plus each device as it moves along the points.
